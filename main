# This is to estimate the time taken by the code
start = timeit.default_timer()

# As alphabetically eight will be the first word in sorted numbers. So the output should start with 8. Also for a shorter range I checked that the ending of the output number is always 5. As the range is large I had to optimize the time taken. For that tried 2-3 methods. The time optimization is given by th below code where I only check numbbers that are starting with 8 and ending with 5.

list=[]
for i in range(1,8):
    num=10**i
    for j in range(8*num+5,9*num,10):
        # converting the number to word
        x=num2words(j)
        list.append(x)

# This is sorting of the array list of numbers
sorted = sorted(list)

# Selecting the first number from the sorted list and converting that word to number
result=w2n.word_to_num(sorted[0])

#This is timer stop
stop = timeit.default_timer()
print('Time: ', stop - start)

# output
# 808085
# eight hundred and eight thousand and eighty-five
# Time:  591.7078378
